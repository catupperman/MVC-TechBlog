## Description
> This project was a build from scratch full stack application for a commenting webpage, for web developers to leave helpful comments to each other. This was the first full stack application I've ever built.  There is still more work to be done, and I plan to take the time to fix what needs help.  This project was mostly a struggle for me since my home was flooded during this project week. I am impressed with how much I built out but I am aware it is not fully complete.

## Installation
> I pulled the [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) package, aka ```package.json```, entered ```npm install``` , and then used the ```require``` method to direct the routes for each of the items within the directory.
